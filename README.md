# HelloToast Android Application

## Overview

HelloToast is a simple Android application that demonstrates basic user interaction and layout design. The app features two buttons and a text view:

1. Toast Button: Displays a short message (Toast) when pressed.
2. Count Button: Increments a counter and displays the current count in a TextView.

The application is implemented using two different layout types:
- ConstraintLayout
- LinearLayout

## Features

- Display Toast messages
- Increment and display a counter
- Demonstrate usage of ConstraintLayout and LinearLayout

## Layout Comparison

### ConstraintLayout

ConstraintLayout allows for flexible positioning and sizing of child views. It's more complex but powerful, enabling responsive designs that work well across different screen sizes.

### LinearLayout

LinearLayout arranges its children in a single row or column. It's simpler to use but less flexible for complex layouts.
- `MainActivity.kt`: Contains the main logic for the application.
- `activity_main_constraint.xml`: ConstraintLayout version of the UI.
- `activity_main_linear.xml`: LinearLayout version of the UI.
